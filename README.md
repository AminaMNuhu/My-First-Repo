THEME AND OVERVIEW
This game an underwater theme and takes place in and underwater castle/palace

NARRATIVE
The narrative element of the game follows one character who the player controls, whose goal is to travel through the ruins of the underwater castle without colliding into the walls and to collect as many treasure chests as they can while simultaneously waking it to the finish line (a door out of the underwater world)

AESTHETIC
The general aesthetic of the game is reminiscent of popular retro games of the 1980s such as super mario bros and tetris. These games are known for their pixelated aesthetic, which I intended to imitate in this game. 

ANYTHING YOUâ€™D ADD?  
With a few more weeks to work on and properly finish this project and a full studio behind me I would implement a range of elements to make the game more immersive. I would add sound to the game. This would include background music to mimic the underwater atmosphere, as well as sound effects to heighten the users gameplay experience. There would also be the addition of enemies to attack the player namely, sharks and trolls. 
I would also work on the side scrolling element of the game by adding different levels/rooms in the game that the player can progress to. Since the game is set underwater, a progression level/additional room could be set on the surface level of the ocean (some decor could be ships and islands, etc). Since the finish line of the game would be the player going through the door, I would instead make this the gateway to the next progression level rather than simply ending the game there. 
With more advanced and technical knowledge I would add animation to my game. For instance animating the player and sprites. This would make it appear as the player being able to do movements such as rolling into a ball (somersaulting) and other movements like sliding. I would finally also implement floating platforms in the game, similar to those we see in the super mario bros game.
